# Diabetes_Prediction

- I created a Diabetes Prediction model in Machine Learning where I used different algorithms like Decision tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support vector machine for better accuracy.

- This can be useful for healthcare professionals to identifying patients who are suffering from diabetes and they can get treatment earlier.
